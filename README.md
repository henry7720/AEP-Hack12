# AEP Challenge: HackOHI/O 12
For the AEP challenge our objective was to take in a CSV data source, parse it, then categorize the events listed based on their safety risk by presence of "high energy" situations. Unfortunately, I can't share the source data because it must be anonymous. However, I am happy to share more about the process.

This was run on Python 3.12 (although the version shouldn't matter), with ollama, csv, pandas, and plotly (express) libraries imported.
